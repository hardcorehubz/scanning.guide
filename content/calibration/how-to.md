Get a **RAW scan** of your IT8 card. If you have gone through the [Software](/software) part of the guide,you should be able to use Canon or Epson scanning software to get a RAW scan of your card. VueScan is a bit different and is an all in one step, please see the link below. Your scan should look quite dark and somewhat similar to this image.

Now that you a RAW Scan you need to run it through calibration software. Here are a few options we recommend:

1. [Vuescan (Windows, Mac, Linux)][1]
2. [Rough Profiler (Windows & Mac)][2]
3. [ArgyII Color Management System (Linux)][3]

The output from VueScan and Rough Profiler/ArgyIICMS can vary, but all will greatly improve the color accuracy of your scans. Pick the solution that works for you. There is a way to benchmark your results to see which is technically more correct, see [this tutorial][4].

It's alwaus best to calibrate your own scanner and get an ICC/ICM file that way, but if you have the same model as one below you can try to apply these calibrated files and see how it looks.
