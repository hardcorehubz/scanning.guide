To get the **best possible color scans** from your scanner you need to calibrate it. This is quite involved and requires you to order an IT8 calibration card (see below). 

RAW scans without being calibrated are still valuable, however if there is an ICC or ICM file attached to the scan, it makes reproducing the correct colors during post-processing much easier.

If you're willing to go through the trouble of aquiring an IT8 calibration card and creating a profile for your scanner, that's great!

We'll go through how to calibrate and get an ICC/ICM file that you can use later in photo editing software such as Adobe PhotoShop or GIMP, for your scans to be color calibrated to our specific scanner. There are CanoScan 9000F Mark II calibrated files provided if you happen to use that model. It *should* be better than nothing if you're unable to calibrate your own. If others want to add their scanner model calibrated files for other models please [create a PR][pr] or contact @jonasrosland or @Hubz in the [Discord][discord].

## How to get an affordable IT8 card
Order an [IT8 Card from here][1]. Make sure you order the R1 option. Also take note of the Charge# as you'll need to download that target.it8 file from the bottom of this page that matches up to that.
