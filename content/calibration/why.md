To get the **best possible color scans** from your scanner you need to calibrate it. This is quite involved and requires you to order an IT8 calibration card (see below). 

Without calibration your scans will tend to look flat and lifeless. Calibration is something we strongly encourage you to do if you can. If you’re unable to, we might be able to provide scanner calibrated ICC/ICM files that others have done for your scanner model, but ideally you would want to calibrate your own scanner every 3-6 months. That being said RAW scans without being calibrated are still valuable, however if there is an ICC or ICM file attached to the scan, it makes reproducing the correct colors during post-processing much easier.

If you’re willing to go through the trouble of acquiring an IT8 calibration card and creating a profile for your scanner, that’s great!

## Scanner Profiles

We’ll go through how to calibrate and get an ICC/ICM file that you can use later in photo editing software such as Adobe PhotoShop or GIMP, for your scans to be color calibrated to our specific scanner. If you have a calibrated a scanner we haven’t and would like to submit your scanner model calibrated files for other models please [create a PR][pr] or contact @jonasrosland or @Hubz in the [Discord][discord]. Here’s a list of what we currently have:

[Epson V550][V550]
[Epson Expression 10000XL][10000XL]
[Canon Canoscan 9000F Mark II][9000F]

## Where to get an affordable IT8 card
Order an [IT8 Card from here][1]. Make sure you order the R1 option. Also take note of the Charge# as you'll need to download that target.it8 file from the bottom of this page that matches up to that.
