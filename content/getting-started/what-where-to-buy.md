The Epson Perfection v550 scanner is the sweet spot ([170$ on Amazon][1]). Another scanner often mentioned in the same breath is the Epson Perfection v600, however it doesn't offer any useful features or benefits for our purposes.

Another solid option is the Canon CanoScan 9000F Mark II ([Amazon Link][2]). It's around the same price as the Epson and has similar features.

To interface with the scanner, you will need scanning software compatible with your computer. Most scanners come with their own complementary software which will give you some advanced options, and there is also [VueScan][3] which is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux OS. See the Software section for further details on set-up for your program of choice.
