The Epson Perfection v550 scanner is the sweet spot ([170$ on Amazon][1]). Another scanner often mentioned in the same breath is the Epson Perfection v600, however it doesn't offer any useful features or benefits for our purposes.

Another solid option is the Canon CanoScan 9000F Mark II ([Amazon Link][2]). It's around the same price as the Epson and has similar features.

You will also need a Windows or Macintosh computer for the compatible software that usually comes bundled with the scanner. Linux is doable as well with the program [VueScan][3] as it supports most scanners in Linux.
