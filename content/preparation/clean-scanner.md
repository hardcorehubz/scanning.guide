You'd be surprised how many specks of things will get left behind when you scan. Be sure to clean your scanner with some glass cleaner and a micro-cloth before-hand, and you probably want to reapply every few scans or if you notice particles/smudges on the glass when previewing. Scans with particles and smudges only make them harder to clean up in post.
