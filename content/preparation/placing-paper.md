**Do not align your paper against the edge of the scanner, doing so will cut off the edges of the scanned content.**

Scanners tend to have two corners of the actual scanning bed that cut off a lot more than the opposing sides. We can use that space for materials to help straighten our scans as it's lost space anyway, and we want to make sure we have the most space possible for scanning while also keeping things as straight as possible.

For example on the *CanoScan 9000F Mark II* the left and bottom sides of the scanner cut off a lot more than the top and right. If you're using a different model you'll need to do some test scans to figure out which sides it cuts off more in your case.


## Carpenter Squares & Rulers
These are great for scanning boxes due to their thickness but usually NOT manual pages as they are too thin and the pages can slide underneath. One recommendation is the [SHINWA CARPENTER'S SQUARE 30CM*15CM Model No. 12130][1]. It does require a trim on the 30CM side to fit the flatbed which is kind of tricky as it's stainless steel. However if you have the tools to do that it's a great solution as it's thinness fits within the scanner well.

Another option that's easier to trim down but isn't as easy to lineup as a square is [CARL RM-12/2 12-Inch Cutting Mat for all 12-Inch Trimmers][2].

## Alignment

Now place your square/rules along the corner of your scanner which you know has more dead space, press your flattened boxes up against its corner to get a straight scan, and lower your flatbed lid. Place a heavy book or object on top of the scanner to flatten the box as much as possible and hit **Preview** on your scanning software. If the scan looks straight go ahead and scan it! If not readjust and preview again until you're satisfied.

## Bandaids

Great for manual pages as they stop most pages from slipping underneath. These can be tricky to lineup, and you'll want to use small thin ones and place them along the edge of your scanner. Try to get them as straight as possible. They should then easily catch your manual pages when you scan them. Remember to **REMOVE your square or ruler** before scanning your manual pages, as its thickness will block the manual pages from getting as flat as possible. 

Another important point when scanning a manual, consider removing the staples for a higher quality scan. Again place a book or something heavy to get the scan as flat as possible, and do a preview before scanning to make sure the manual pages are straight enough. These are notoriously hard to get straight so just do your best.
