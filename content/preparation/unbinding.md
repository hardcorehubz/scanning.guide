**THIS IS OPTIONAL**

Manuals with binding can be really hard to scan properly, and often have to **basically be destroyed** to get a flat scan. It's understandable if you don't want to do this, however if you're willing to sacrifice your manual for the greater good of preservation you'll need to get the pages unbound.

There are various ways to do this such as cutting, or using a heat gun to loosen the adhesive and pull the pages apart. Both are tricky and it's best to practice on some more common or less valuable manuals/books to get the hang of it as it's easy to not make a straight cut, or ruin pages by heating them too long with a heat gun. A final option is to contact us in the [Discord][discord] and mail your manual to someone who has experience unbinding and having them scan it.

## Example of how to unbind a book for scanning
_From community member Bigmanjapan_  
It all depends on how the pages, especially the outer cover, are made. Some outer covers have something like lamination that is applied to them, so heating them up could damage the surface. If you're unsure, scan the front and the back of the guide before unbinding it.
Very recently we unbound two Killer7 PS2 guides, using a simple 1700W hairdryer.
Guides like these are made with the multiple 8-pages "notebooks" pressed together. To start, you unbind one side of the outer cover, then you unbind the pages in groups of 8. If you try to pull individual pages one by one, you will most likely rip them off, sometimes ruining the pages in the process.
If you are careful enough, you can unbind the book without any damage.
When you unbind the 8-pages segments, detach the individual spreads and leave them to cool off. The glue will harden and it will be much easier to clean it off.
If you try to clean the glue while it's still heated, it will simply smudge and leave uncleanable stains.

In the picture below you can see that the first few pages are completely torn off, but the rest were unbound using the 8-pages segments method which left them unharmed.
