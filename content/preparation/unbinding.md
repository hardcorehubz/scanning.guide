**THIS IS OPTIONAL**

Manuals with binding can be really hard to scan properly, and often have to **basically be destroyed** to get a flat scan. It's understandable if you don't want to do this, however if you're willing to sacrifice your manual for the greater good of preservation you'll need to get the pages unbound.

There are various ways to do this such as cutting, or using a heat gun to loosen the adhesive and pull the pages apart. Both are tricky and it's best to practice on some more common or less valuable manuals/books to get the hang of it as it's easy to not make a straight cut, or ruin pages by heating them too long with a heat gun. A final option is to contact us in the [Discord][discord] and mail your manual to someone who has experience debinding and having them scan it.
