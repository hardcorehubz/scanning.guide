## Scanning RAW (Uncalibrated) with Canon-brand Scanners

This guide is for scanning based off our experience with a CanoScan 9000F Mark II.
This may or may not be able to be applied to other Canon scanners.


If you're unable to use Vuescan, then you'll need to install the CanoScan software that came with your scanner.
This should include software called "ScanGear" or "Canon IJ Scan Utility". When opened it will look like this:

Click the ScanGear button on the right side to get started. You'll be presented with a screen similar to this:

To get a clean untouched RAW scan at the best quality we're going to need to adjust settings.

1. Click the Advanced Mode tab along the top if you're not in that mode already.
2. Click the Preferences button along the bottom of the screen.
3. Go to the Scan tab of the Preferences window.
4. Make sure **Enabled 48/16 bit Output** is checked.

See highlighted picture below:

5. Click the Color Settings tab
6. Mark the **None** option and adjust the **Monitor Gamma** setting to 1.00.

See highlighted picture below:

Click OK and you'll get back to the scanning screen. We'll need to make a few more adjustments here, but it should remember them from here on and you'll be ready to scan!

7. In the **Color Mode** drop down menu, make sure it's set to **Color(48bit)**.
8. Set your output resolution to at least **900dpi**.
9. Make sure all **Image Settings** are **turned off** or set to **None**.

Now you are ready to scan in your items in high quality with your CanoScan 9000F Mark II.
