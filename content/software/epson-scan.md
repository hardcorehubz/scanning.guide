## Scanning RAW (Uncalibrated) with Epson-brand Scanners

Your Epson scanner likely came with the appropriate software for it but if you want to get the latest version or don’t have your install disc you’ll need to go to [Epson's support page][2] and find your scanner model then look in the downloads section for Epson Scan and download and install it. The version showed below is the Epson Scan for the V550 but others are likely similar.


## Settings

Basically you want to set your scanning resolution to 1200DPI, and either 24-bit or 48-bit color depending on which you want to do. Then turn off ANY adjustments such as Unsharp Mask, Descreening, or Color Restoration. Be warned if you want to go 48-bit you will likely run into issues scanning larger things as Epson Scan seems to have a limit at 48-bit with these. If you are dead set on doing 48-bit with your Epson scanner you’ll most likely have to use the Vuescan software insead.

Then, continue with these settings:
1. Click on "**Configuration**" at the bottom center of the app
1. Choose "**No Color Correction**", then "OK" to close out.
1. Now that you're all set up, press "Scan" on the app.
1. A new window will pop up, make sure Image Format Type is set to "**TIFF**".

The result of these settings will be a RAW scanner sensor output. It will result in a “flat” color profile that may not look pretty and fairly dull. However, this preserves the untouched image data for archival purposes and with an IT8 profile we can create and attach later it will look much better.
