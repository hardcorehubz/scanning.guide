## Scanning RAW (Uncalibrated) with Epson-brand Scanners

Software and Settings
Download the "[Scanner Driver and Epson Scan 2 Utility][1]".

Start "Epson Scan", and configure it with these settings:

Then, continue with these settings:
1. Click on "**Configuration**" at the bottom center of the app
2. Choose "**No Color Correction**", then "OK" to close out.

Now that you're all set up, press "Scan" on the app.

3. A new window will pop up, make sure Image Format Type is set to "**TIFF**".

The result of these settings will be a RAW scanner sensor output. It will result in a "flat" color profile that may not look pretty and fairly dark. However, this preserves the most image data for archival purposes.
