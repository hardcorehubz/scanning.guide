## Scanning RAW Images with VueScan

Open up VueScan and make sure to set the Input tab with the following settings. Also below is a screenshot of how it _might look_ (Options differ depending on scanner model used).

1. Options: Professional
2. Task: Profile Scanner
3. Bits per pixel: 24 bit RGB (You can do up to 48 bit RGB if you like but it is not required.)
4. Scan resolution: Custom
5. Scan dpi: 1600 for Epson brand scanners, 1200 for Canon brand scanners. 600dpi is acceptable only if you're unable to go higher without image issues, or what you're scanning is in great shape and undamaged.
6. Source: Make sure your scanner is visible / selected.

13. In the upper left app menu choose "File" > "Save Settings".
14. In the bottom left of the app choose "Preview" to see your scan, this might not look like your final output, however don't worry if the preview looks off, go ahead and draw your cropping box around your image and select the Scan button. If your output looks like a dark RAW image you're good to go!
